MKS is good to copy others hardware, invent original software - not so much.

Would you rather support your own development, such as:
https://github.com/robotsrulz/MKS-TFT
https://www.patreon.com/robotsrulz/creators

With help of some 27+ people who can already build it:
https://github.com/robotsrulz/MKS-TFT/network/members

Vote here if you are willing to contribute time or money to **USF - User Supported Firmware**.

And drop a line to the developer `Roman Stepanov <robots.rulz@gmail.com>` asking him to pretty please resume his work.
